# StockPredictor
A machine learning stock predictor. Any stock, any time. This is not financial advice.

Chose a linear regression model. This kind of model predicts the closing price of a stock. In the case of a classification model in the stock market, it will predict if a stocks price will decrease or increase the following day. I felt a linear regression model was more fitting in this scenario. When dealing with money, a set price is a lot easier to both deal with and handle.
